Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.

A sorting algorithm are the algorithums that used to sort the list or an array.There are multiple sorting algorithums out there, few are mention in project.

#### To learn about SDL2 Check this Out: [SDL2 BASIC](sdltutorial.com/sdl-tutorial-basics)

## Requirment

- [C++](mingw-w64/org/downloads/)
- [SDL2](libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - Download

## Installation

[SDL2](lazyfoo.net/tutorial/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/index.php) - How to download and install SDL2 ?

## Usage

After Init your can use keyboard Event to select the menu items and press q to exit.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-

- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
